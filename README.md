####Data source:
This dataset is collected by Los Angeles Times. It includes information of over 900 police killing cases in Los Angeles County from 2000 to 2021. 
It is a pretty clean dataset 

####Methodology:
I broke down the dataset by year and race. I also used US Census data to compare each race's case rates and percentage of total population.

####Findings:
There are 928 police killing cases in Los Angeles County from 2000 till now.
Most killing type were gunshot.
Latino has the highest case rate.
